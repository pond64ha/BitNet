## Introduction

BitNet serves as a bridge between cutting-edge research and practical applications. The framework allows users to leverage the power of 1-bit LLMs, making it easier to implement and experiment with various models. With BitNet, you can optimize performance while minimizing resource consumption.

## Features

- **Lightweight Architecture**: Designed for efficiency, BitNet reduces memory usage and speeds up inference.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing machine learning libraries.
- **Customizable**: Modify components to suit specific research needs.
- **Robust Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Installation

To get started with BitNet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pond64ha/BitNet.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd BitNet
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed BitNet, you can start using it for your inference tasks. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```python
from bitnet import BitModel

# Initialize the model
model = BitModel()

# Load your data
data = "Your input data here"

# Perform inference
result = model.infer(data)

print(result)
```

For more detailed usage examples, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/pond64ha/BitNet/wiki).
